1 - When using socket.socket(FAMILY, TYPE, ...), to specify a TCP connection, family should be set to socket.AF_INET or socket.AF_INET6 
  - and type should be set to socket.SOCK_STREAM
2 - A server socket needs to bind host and port address together so a server socket will call bind(), not a client socket.
  - Server sockets also call listen() and accept(). Listen() allows the socket to listen to signals from the binded port and accept() allows 
  - connections to be accepted from the client. This does not need to be done in a client socket program
3 - In the s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) call, the socket.SO_REUSEADDR tag tells the OS to let us reuse the same port
4 - In the s.accept() call, we have two return values: conn, address
      - conn is a new socket object used to send and recieve data on the connection
      - address is the address bound to the socket (where the info is coming from)
6 - recv(BUFFERSIZE) returns the data recieved from the socket. The amount of data is limited by the buffer size parameter
